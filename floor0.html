  <p>Led by director Jeffrey Rack, PhD, the Laboratory for Magneto-optical Spectroscopy is one of a very few number of laboratories world-wide that can make broad-band steady state and time-resolved magneto-optical measurements. This technology promises to reveal electronic and magnetic details from a wide variety of commercially relevant photoactive materials.
    <br><br>By utilizing their expertise in spectroscopy with their chemical knowledge, the lab is uniquely positioned to not only make sophisticated measurements from the femtosecond to microsecond, 
    but to also create tailored materials to optimize and exploit specific chemical interactions. Materials that show large magneto-optical responses are employed in high-technology optical switches and novel optical materials in a variety of applications. The labâ€™s instruments can even detect UV to the near infrared (N-IR).

  <p>As the only academic facility of its kind in New Mexico, the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility (NCF) provides a vital resource to researchers throughout the state. The instruments in this lab are capable of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam techniques and transmission electron microscopy in order to analyze the chemistry and structure of a variety of synthetic and natural materials. Through multiple collaborations throughout the state, the NCF is able to study everything from minerals found from NASA and JAXA space missions to semiconductors and other man-made materials that support our modern day living.</p>
