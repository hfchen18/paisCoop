  <p>
    Launched in 2019 in the brand new state-of-the-art Physics & Astronomy Interdisciplinary Science (PAÍS) facility, the University of New Mexico (UNM) Interdisciplinary Science Cooperative (IS Co-op) is dedicated to fostering relationships across disciplines throughout campus and beyond in order to strengthen our research and educational outcomes.
    <br><br>Within the Co-op, we are proud to have seven Centers and Core Laboratories that work with a diverse community of individual principal investigators, centers, and labs throughout the world in order to broaden their research outcomes. The IS Co-op is dedicated to supporting their efforts by providing them with the resources necessary to develop fresh, bold ideas that inspire and expand upon their research.
    <br><br>From various collaborative spaces designed to inspire teamwork, to events and project support designed to promote and engage new ideas, the IS Co-op is creating a foundation of success for the University - and beyond. The work being done here stands to significantly impact the state of New Mexico: the individuals leading our labs are providing our students an education that is on par with other top Universities throughout the country and those students are leaving equipped to invent the technologies, start the companies, and solve the problems of tomorrow.

  <p>
  The Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), as part of the Interdisciplinary Science Co-op, is well positioned as an established hub for Quantum Information Science (QIS) collaboration activities that focus on theoretical and experimental research, education, and workforce development. CQuIC is instrumental in growing New Mexico’s participation in expanding the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) to extend the reach of QIS in pioneering new practical advances in quantum systems. CQuIC continues to strengthen partnerships with adjunct faculty from Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory who provide a broader focus for CQuIC’s QIS research as well as employment opportunities for CQuIC graduate students. CQuIC's interdisciplinary reach grows, with new activities in UNM Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.  CQuIC’s goal is to promote and develop multidisciplinary research and education in QIS at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level at UNM.
