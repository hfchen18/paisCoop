  </div>
  <p>Led by director Jeffrey Rack, PhD, the Laboratory for Magneto-optical Spectroscopy is one of a very few number of laboratories world-wide that can make broad-band steady state and time-resolved magneto-optical measurements. This technology promises to reveal electronic and magnetic details from a wide variety of commercially relevant photoactive materials.
    <br><br>By utilizing their expertise in spectroscopy with their chemical knowledge, the lab is uniquely positioned to not only make sophisticated measurements from the femtosecond to microsecond, 
    but to also create tailored materials to optimize and exploit specific chemical interactions. Materials that show large magneto-optical responses are employed in high-technology optical switches and novel optical materials in a variety of applications. The lab’s instruments can even detect UV to the near infrared (N-IR).

  <p>As the only academic facility of its kind in New Mexico, the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility (NCF) provides a vital resource to researchers throughout the state. The instruments in this lab are capable of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam techniques and transmission electron microscopy in order to analyze the chemistry and structure of a variety of synthetic and natural materials. Through multiple collaborations throughout the state, the NCF is able to study everything from minerals found from NASA and JAXA space missions to semiconductors and other man-made materials that support our modern day living.</p>

  <p>PAÍS was built with the intent to bring people together and the spaces within it reflect this throughout. Brightly colored areas, like the Lobby, indicate open areas within the building that anyone is welcome to collaborate in at any given moment. No reservation required. White boards, tables, and USB ports are all available in these spaces and everyone has access to the Wi-Fi within the building to expand upon their ideas.
    <br><br> Across from the Lobby is on one of our newest installations, the PAÍS donor wall. As a thank you to those who helped make the building and the programs within it possible, the donor wall stands as a testament to the power of people coming together to create change.

  <p>
    Launched in 2019 in the brand new state-of-the-art Physics & Astronomy Interdisciplinary Science (PAÍS) facility, the University of New Mexico (UNM) Interdisciplinary Science Cooperative (IS Co-op) is dedicated to fostering relationships across disciplines throughout campus and beyond in order to strengthen our research and educational outcomes.
    <br><br>Within the Co-op, we are proud to have seven Centers and Core Laboratories that work with a diverse community of individual principal investigators, centers, and labs throughout the world in order to broaden their research outcomes. The IS Co-op is dedicated to supporting their efforts by providing them with the resources necessary to develop fresh, bold ideas that inspire and expand upon their research.
    <br><br>From various collaborative spaces designed to inspire teamwork, to events and project support designed to promote and engage new ideas, the IS Co-op is creating a foundation of success for the University - and beyond. The work being done here stands to significantly impact the state of New Mexico: the individuals leading our labs are providing our students an education that is on par with other top Universities throughout the country and those students are leaving equipped to invent the technologies, start the companies, and solve the problems of tomorrow.

  <p>
  The Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), as part of the Interdisciplinary Science Co-op, is well positioned as an established hub for Quantum Information Science (QIS) collaboration activities that focus on theoretical and experimental research, education, and workforce development. CQuIC is instrumental in growing New Mexico’s participation in expanding the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) to extend the reach of QIS in pioneering new practical advances in quantum systems. CQuIC continues to strengthen partnerships with adjunct faculty from Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory who provide a broader focus for CQuIC’s QIS research as well as employment opportunities for CQuIC graduate students. CQuIC's interdisciplinary reach grows, with new activities in UNM Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering.  CQuIC’s goal is to promote and develop multidisciplinary research and education in QIS at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral level at UNM.

        The University of New Mexico (UNM) which is the state’s only Carnegie-designated R1 research institution and one of 14 R1 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) in the country, is proud to offer a brand-new graduate-level research experience through the Museum Research Traineeship (MRT). In a state rich with history and tradition, the MRT is dedicated to increasing diversity in STEM and encouraging collaboration across disciplines in order to better understand our past as well as our future. 
<br><br>A collaborative effort among the Museum of Southwestern Biology, the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, and the Paleobiology Collection in Earth and Planetary Sciences at UNM, the MRT is an interdisciplinary training program that utilizes our institution’s world-class museum collections to better understand critical contemporary issues, including past and future changes to the global environment and their impacts on human communities and biological and earth system resources.
<br><br>Throughout their graduate programs, MS and PhD students will be exposed to cutting-edge imaging and material science technology to develop new ways to interpret museum objects, such as biological specimens, pottery sherds, fossils, geological samples, and associated data.  By breaking traditional disciplinary boundaries within museum science, students will not only have an opportunity to expand our current understanding of these histories but to also translate their findings in a way that will ultimately impact future research, education, and policy.

            The Rio Grande Research Collaborative is dedicated to exploring the social-ecological research questions associated with the Rio Grande Water Fund and its approach, along with other ongoing activities in the watershed.  This is a unique opportunity for the University of New Mexico to develop an ongoing, transdisciplinary research collaborative involving UNM faculty, students at all levels of education, as well as community members and stakeholders in the watershed.
            <br><br>Whether you're an expert in water sustainability, or interested in the topic itself, we invite you to join us for a special webinar series this fall that will begin exploring the specific issues involved in the Rio Grande watershed and transdisciplinarity.

                Undergraduate students from any and all majors are eligible for this unique interdisciplinary opportunity to gain hands-on experience in water resource systems and models, culminating in the research and development of a dynamic simulation model of the Middle Rio Grande. Any undergraduate student who has an interest in water sustainability and/or research, is encouraged to consider applying.  
                <br><br>This fellowship is made possible by the Dr. Roger and Teri Jones Interdisciplinary Science Fund. An alumnus of the School of Engineering, Dr. Jones's passion for water sustainability combined with his curiosity for simulations models inspired this unique undergraduate experience. If you would like to join the Jones' in their pursuit to expose undergraduate students to research opportunities that will impact our communities, please consider making a gift to their fund. 
                <br><br>Our 2020-2021 fellowship cohort, which consisted of Sofia Jenkins-Nieto (BS candidate, Environmental Science, 2022), Atlin Johnson (BS candidate, Civil Engineering, 2022), and Yoko Kentilitisca (BS candidate, Population Health, 2021), were mentored by graduate student Sean O'Neill from the Water Resources program in developing a simulated game about the water resource issues in the Rio Grande. By combining their various disciplinary backgrounds with the knowledge they gained over the past year in their graduate-level courses, they have created an interactive game that integrates the sectors of water management, public health, and environmental justice to create more urban green spaces in an era of rapid climate change. The simulation is designed specifically for the Albuquerque area with the overall intent of promoting green spaces by planting trees using stormwater discharge that is not being actively used.
